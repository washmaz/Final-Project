# Final-Project
To do list application
Project Name: Interactive To-Do List Web Application
Overview:
The purpose of the Interactive To-Do List Web Application project is to provide students with a hands-on learning experience in web development and software engineering principles. By designing, implementing, and testing a dynamic web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, students enhance their skills while applying concepts such as requirements analysis, design, coding, and testing.
Through this project, students gain practical experience in problem analysis, system design, and application development, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. The project allows students to use their knowledge learned in the course of Principles of Software and Requirements.

Requirements:
Task Addition: Users should be able to add tasks via an input method, enhancing the to-do list dynamically.
Task Deletion: A delete function allows users to remove tasks, keeping the list tidy and focused.
Mark task done: Provides a feature that would allow a user to mark the task as done with a visual change in appearance of the task or moving it into a separate area.
Prioritizing: It allows the user to prioritize the items at hand, ensuring that most or the best is given to the top of the list.
Due Dates: Adding due dates to tasks helps users manage their time more efficiently.
Database Integration: All tasks and their respective details are stored in a database for persistent storage.
